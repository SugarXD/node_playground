    # This is useful if you often do change the version without saying it in the

    # You can use this to make the action use an URL to get the package file,
    # instead of using the one in your repo.
    # Please note that the action will expect the version from that package file to
    # be the same as the one that has been added in the commit: if you want to
    # change this behavior take a look at the `assume-same-version` option.
    # You can also set this to '::before', and the action will use the file from
    # before the push event.

    # file-url: https://unpkg.com/pkg/package.json

    # You can use this to make the action use the current version (either from the
    # local file or the provided URL, see the `file-url` option) as either the added
    # or deleted version.
    # Accepted values are 'new' (if you want that version to be the "added" one) and
    # 'old' (to make it the "deleted" one).
    # Default: ''
    assume-same-version: old

    # You can use this option to make the action check the local version against the
    # remote one (from the provided URL, see the `file-url` option).
    # Accepted values are 'localIsNew' (if you expect the local version to be newer
    # than the remote one) and `remoteIsNew`.
    # Please note that using the wrong value may make the action detect the change
    # but fail to identify the type.
